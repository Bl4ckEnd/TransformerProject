# TransformerProject
This is the github repository for our project in the class MÃ©thodes de l'IA (Methods of Artificial Intelligence). The project consists of implementing a model for sentiment analysis for movie reviews. The model predicts whether a review is good (1), or bad (0). The architecture is based on the Transformer architecture from the paper "Attention is all you need".
